# Library-Management-System

Heya! This is a small library management program I did a couple of years ago in one of my classes. It obviously has some flaws, but I still do think it's pretty neat! 

The main idea of this program is the possibility of adding "new books" to your "library" and being able to borrow/devolute/exclude them.
As it has been a while, even though I did refactored some of the parts, I'm pretty sure there must be some small issues once in a while. Sorry about that!!

Anyways, I do expect to publish a bit more of my university projects :) 

Have a great day!
